The Wearables folder contains the .stl files and technical drawings of the mechanical components of the device. The .stl format can be directly used for 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing, while the technical drawings illustrate the dimensions of each part codified in ISO standards. These are grouped into two subfolders: IMU Case and RPI Box. 

A separate .stl file exists for every part component, while these are grouped together in the technical drawings. The components of the IMU Case and of the RPI box are as follows:

<dl>
  <b>IMU Case</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Top component</li>
  <li>Bottom component</li>
</ul>
</dl>
<dl>
 <b>RPI Box</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Base</li>
  <li>Cover</li>
  <li>Support</li>
  <li>Hook</li>
</ul>
</dl>

A description of each of these components and relative illustrations can be found in the Wiki of the repository.
